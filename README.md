IMPORTING NOTES - WHEN IMPORTING, IMPORT PLAYER ATTRIBUTES BEFORE PLAYER STATS
* AT END OF PLAYOFFS, EXPORT PLAYER STATS CSV AND EXPORT PLAYER ATTRIBUTES CSV
* IMPORT PLAYER ATTRIBUTES CSV
* IMPORT PLAYER STATS CSV
EG) IMPORT PLAYER ATTRIBUTES WITH YEAR BEING 2024 (CONSIDER IT YOUR PLAYERS' ATTRIBUTES AT THE END OF THE 2023-2024 SEASON IF THAT MAKES MORE SENSE),
    THEN IMPORT PLAYER STATS FROM 2023-2024 SEASON WITH YEAR BEING 2024
THUS, YOUR PLAYERS' HAD X ATTRIBUTES AT THE END OF THE 2023-2024 SEASON, AND SCORED Y POINTS.
